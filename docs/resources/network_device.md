# openwrt_network_device (Resource)

A physical or virtual "device" in OpenWrt jargon. Commonly referred to as an "interface" in other networking jargon.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "openwrt_network_device" "br_testing" {
  id   = "br_testing"
  name = "br-testing"
  ports = [
    "eth0",
    "eth1",
    "eth2.20",
  ]
  type = "bridge"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Name of the section. This name is only used when interacting with UCI directly.
- `name` (String) Name of the device. This name is referenced in other network configuration.
- `type` (String) The type of device. Currently, only "bridge" is supported.

### Optional

- `bridge_empty` (Boolean) Bring up the bridge device even if no ports are attached
- `dadtransmits` (Number) Amount of Duplicate Address Detection probes to send
- `ipv6` (Boolean) Enable IPv6 for the device.
- `macaddr` (String) MAC Address of the device.
- `mtu` (Number) Maximum Transmissible Unit.
- `mtu6` (Number) Maximum Transmissible Unit for IPv6.
- `ports` (Set of String) Specifies the wired ports to attach to this bridge.
- `txqueuelen` (Number) Transmission queue length.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Find the Terraform id and UCI name from LuCI's JSON-RPC API.
# One way to find this information is with `curl` and `jq`:
#
# curl \
#     --data '{"id": 0, "method": "foreach", "params": ["network", "device"]}' \
#     http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci/rpc/uci?auth=$AUTH_TOKEN \
#     | jq '.result | map({terraformId: .[".name"], uciName: .name})'
#
# This command will output something like:
#
# [
#   {
#     "terraformId": "cfg030f15",
#     "uciName": "foo"
#   },
#   {
#     "terraformId": "cfg040f15",
#     "uciName": "bar"
#   }
# ]
#
# We'd then use the information to import the appropriate resource:

terraform import openwrt_network_device.foo cfg030f15
```
