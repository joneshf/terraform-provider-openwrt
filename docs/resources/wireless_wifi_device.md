## Schema

### Required

- `channel` (String) The wireless channel. Currently, only "auto" is supported.
- `id` (String) Name of the section. This name is only used when interacting with UCI directly.
- `type` (String) The type of device. Currently only "mac80211" is supported.

### Optional

- `band` (String) Channel width. Must be one of: "2g", "5g", "6g".
- `cell_density` (Number) Configures data rates based on the coverage cell density. Must be one of 0, 1, 2, 3.
- `country` (String) Two-digit country code. E.g. "US".
- `htmode` (String) Channel width. Must be one of: "HE20", "HE40", "HE80", "HE160", "HT20", "HT40", "HT40-", "HT40+", "NONE", "VHT20", "VHT40", "VHT80", "VHT160".
- `path` (String) Path of the device in `/sys/devices`.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Find the Terraform id from LuCI's JSON-RPC API.
# One way to find this information is with `curl` and `jq`:
#
# curl \
#     --data '{"id": 0, "method": "foreach", "params": ["wireless", "wifi-device"]}' \
#     http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci/rpc/uci?auth=$AUTH_TOKEN \
#     | jq '.result | map({terraformId: .[".name"]})'
#
# This command will output something like:
#
# [
#   {
#     "terraformId": "cfg123456",
#   },
#   {
#     "terraformId": "cfg123457",
#   }
# ]
#
# We'd then use the information to import the appropriate resource:

terraform import openwrt_wireless_wifi_device.five_ghz cfg123456
```
