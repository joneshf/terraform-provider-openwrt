# openwrt_wireless_wifi_iface (Resource)

A wireless network.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "openwrt_network_interface" "home" {
  device = "eth0"
  dns = [
    "9.9.9.9",
    "1.1.1.1",
  ]
  id      = "home"
  ipaddr  = "192.168.3.1"
  netmask = "255.255.255.0"
  proto   = "static"
}

resource "openwrt_wireless_wifi_device" "five_ghz" {
  band    = "5g"
  channel = "auto"
  id      = "radio0"
  type    = "mac80211"
}

resource "openwrt_wireless_wifi_iface" "home" {
  device                        = openwrt_wireless_wifi_device.five_ghz.id
  encryption                    = "sae"
  id                            = "wifinet0"
  key                           = "password"
  mode                          = "ap"
  network                       = openwrt_network_interface.home.id
  ssid                          = "home"
  wpa_disable_eapol_key_retries = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `device` (String) Name of the physical device. This name is what the device is known as in LuCI/UCI, or the `id` field in Terraform.
- `id` (String) Name of the section. This name is only used when interacting with UCI directly.
- `mode` (String) The operation mode of the wireless network interface controller.. Currently only "ap" is supported.
- `network` (String) Network interface to attach the wireless network. This name is what the interface is known as in UCI, or the `id` field in Terraform.
- `ssid` (String) The broadcasted SSID of the wireless network. This is what actual clients will see the network as.

### Optional

- `encryption` (String) Encryption method. Currently, only PSK encryption methods are supported. Must be one of: "none", "psk", "psk2", "psk2+aes", "psk2+ccmp", "psk2+tkip", "psk2+tkip+aes", "psk2+tkip+ccmp", "psk+aes", "psk+ccmp", "psk-mixed", "psk-mixed+aes", "psk-mixed+ccmp", "psk-mixed+tkip", "psk-mixed+tkip+aes", "psk-mixed+tkip+ccmp", "psk+tkip", "psk+tkip+aes", "psk+tkip+ccmp", "sae", "sae-mixed".
- `isolate` (Boolean) Isolate wireless clients from each other.
- `key` (String, Sensitive) The pre-shared passphrase from which the pre-shared key will be derived. The clear text key has to be 8-63 characters long.
- `wpa_disable_eapol_key_retries` (Boolean) Enable WPA key reinstallation attack (KRACK) workaround. This should be `true` to enable KRACK workaround (you almost surely want this enabled).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Find the Terraform id from LuCI's JSON-RPC API.
# One way to find this information is with `curl` and `jq`:
#
# curl \
#     --data '{"id": 0, "method": "foreach", "params": ["wireless", "wifi-iface"]}' \
#     http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci/rpc/uci?auth=$AUTH_TOKEN \
#     | jq '.result | map({terraformId: .[".name"]})'
#
# This command will output something like:
#
# [
#   {
#     "terraformId": "cfg123456",
#   },
#   {
#     "terraformId": "cfg123457",
#   }
# ]
#
# We'd then use the information to import the appropriate resource:

terraform import openwrt_wireless_wifi_iface.home_network cfg123456
```
