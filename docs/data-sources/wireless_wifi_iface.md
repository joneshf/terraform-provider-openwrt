### Required

- `id` (String) Name of the section. This name is only used when interacting with UCI directly.

### Read-Only

- `device` (String) Name of the physical device. This name is what the device is known as in LuCI/UCI, or the `id` field in Terraform.
- `encryption` (String) Encryption method. Currently, only PSK encryption methods are supported. Must be one of: "none", "psk", "psk2", "psk2+aes", "psk2+ccmp", "psk2+tkip", "psk2+tkip+aes", "psk2+tkip+ccmp", "psk+aes", "psk+ccmp", "psk-mixed", "psk-mixed+aes", "psk-mixed+ccmp", "psk-mixed+tkip", "psk-mixed+tkip+aes", "psk-mixed+tkip+ccmp", "psk+tkip", "psk+tkip+aes", "psk+tkip+ccmp", "sae", "sae-mixed".
- `isolate` (Boolean) Isolate wireless clients from each other.
- `key` (String, Sensitive) The pre-shared passphrase from which the pre-shared key will be derived. The clear text key has to be 8-63 characters long.
- `mode` (String) The operation mode of the wireless network interface controller.. Currently only "ap" is supported.
- `network` (String) Network interface to attach the wireless network. This name is what the interface is known as in UCI, or the `id` field in Terraform.
- `ssid` (String) The broadcasted SSID of the wireless network. This is what actual clients will see the network as.
- `wpa_disable_eapol_key_retries` (Boolean) Enable WPA key reinstallation attack (KRACK) workaround. This should be `true` to enable KRACK workaround (you almost surely want this enabled).
